# Recommended SDD hooks

This file describes hooks that can be enabled in `.claude/settings.json` after developer approval.

## 1. Block implementation before approval

Purpose: prevent edits to source files when a task is only `pending`, `spec_draft` or `spec_ready`.

Recommended event:

- `PreToolUse`

Recommended matchers:

- `Edit`
- `Write`

Script:

```text
hooks/examples/block-implementation-before-approval.sh
```

## 2. Run tests after edits

Purpose: run project tests after relevant source edits.

Recommended event:

- `PostToolUse`

Recommended matchers:

- `Edit|Write`

Script:

```text
hooks/examples/run-tests-after-edit.sh
```

## 3. Validate specs before status changes

Purpose: ensure `requirements.html`, `design.html` and `tasks.html` exist before a task can move to `spec_ready`.

The script reads the PreToolUse JSON from stdin, acts only when the tool call edits `tasks.json` and the proposed content contains `spec_ready`, then verifies the three core spec files exist for the affected feature slug(s). State is read from `tasks.json` and the tool input via `jq`, not from spec file content. It fails open (warning, exit 0) when `jq` is unavailable.

Recommended event:

- `PreToolUse`

Recommended matchers:

- `Edit|Write`

Script:

```text
hooks/examples/validate-spec-before-status-change.sh
```

## 4. Block destructive commands

Purpose: prevent accidental destructive shell commands.

Recommended event:

- `PreToolUse`

Recommended matcher:

- `Bash`

Examples of commands to block or confirm:

- `rm -rf`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `drop database`
- direct edits to secrets or production configs.

## 5. Notify for human approval

Purpose: alert the developer when Claude stops at `spec_ready`.

Recommended event:

- `Stop`
- `Notification`

This is environment-specific and should be configured per OS/team.

## 6. Suggest failure learning (advisory only)

Purpose: when the same validation command fails more than once in a session, remind Claude that the `failure-learning` skill exists. The hook never writes memory and never blocks — any memory write goes through the skill's mandatory confirmation prompt.

Recommended event:

- `PostToolUse`

Recommended matcher:

- `Bash`

Script and details:

```text
hooks/examples/failure-learning/suggest-failure-learning.sh
hooks/examples/failure-learning/README.md
```

Only useful if the `failure-learning` skill pack is installed. Adapt the script's `watch_pattern` to the project's real test/lint commands before enabling.

## 7. Pre-compact capture (advisory)

Purpose: before the context window is compacted, remind that unresolved decisions, current task state, failures, and architecture constraints must live in durable artifacts (`tasks.json`, `specs/`, `decisions/`, `history.html`), not in chat history. A companion script reorients Claude after compaction. Neither script writes memory or project files.

Recommended events:

- `PreCompact` (matcher `manual`; add `auto` for warn mode only)
- `SessionStart` (matcher `compact`) for the reorientation companion

Scripts and details:

```text
hooks/examples/pre-compact-capture/pre-compact-capture.sh
hooks/examples/pre-compact-capture/post-compact-reorient.sh
hooks/examples/pre-compact-capture/README.md
```

Optional `gate` mode blocks the first manual compaction per session with the persistence checklist as the reason. Never wire gate mode to the `auto` matcher.

## 8. Targeted validation (advisory)

Purpose: after an edit, suggest — or optionally run — the targeted check matching the changed file instead of the full suite: frontend changes → frontend checks, backend changes → backend tests, schema changes → migration checks. Never blocks.

Recommended event:

- `PostToolUse`

Recommended matcher:

- `Edit|Write`

Script and details:

```text
hooks/examples/targeted-validation/targeted-validation.sh
hooks/examples/targeted-validation/README.md
```

Adapt the `RULES` table (path pattern → command) to the project's confirmed commands before enabling. Default mode suggests; `VALIDATION_MODE=run` executes the mapped command synchronously.

## 9. Spec drift (advisory by default, blocking opt-in)

Purpose: detect edits outside the approved task scope — files the design/spec did not anticipate. Reads the optional `scope` glob array on active tasks in `tasks.json` (recorded by the spec-author from the design's files-to-change list). No scope recorded means nothing to enforce.

Recommended event:

- `PreToolUse`

Recommended matcher:

- `Edit|Write`

Script and details:

```text
hooks/examples/spec-drift/spec-drift.sh
hooks/examples/spec-drift/README.md
```

`DRIFT_MODE=warn` (default) warns; `DRIFT_MODE=block` denies the edit until the design/spec and the task's `scope` are updated. Start in warn mode.
