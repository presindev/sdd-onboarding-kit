# Detects edits outside the approved task's scope. The scope is the
# optional "scope" array of glob patterns on the active task(s) in
# tasks.json (filled by the spec-author from the design's files-to-change
# list when the spec is approved). Wired to PreToolUse with matcher
# Edit|Write.
#
# Strictness (DRIFT_MODE environment variable, default below):
#   warn (default) - allow the edit but tell Claude it drifted from the
#                    approved scope.
#   block          - deny the edit with the reason; the fix is to update
#                    the design/spec and the task's scope first.
#
# Fails open (allows, no output) when jq, tasks.json, active approved
# tasks, or scope data are missing — no scope recorded means nothing to
# enforce.
