# Example hook script.
# Adapt this script to the project's real task storage and source directories.
# This script assumes local tasks.json and blocks edits to implementation files
# when there is an active SDD task without human approval.
# Edits to spec files (specs/, tasks.json, history.html, etc.) are always allowed.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (deliberate, to keep the example simple): the guard is
# project-wide, not per-task. If ANY sdd:true task is pending/spec_draft/
# spec_ready, ALL implementation edits are blocked — including work on a
# different, already-approved task. If your team runs several SDD tasks in
# parallel, adapt the jq filter to scope the check to the task being worked on
# (e.g. by branch name or an ACTIVE_TASK env var).
