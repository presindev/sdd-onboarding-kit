# Pre-compact capture hook (example, disabled by default).
#
# Before the context window is compacted, remind that durable state must
# live in artifacts (tasks.json, specs/, decisions/, history.html), not in
# chat history. This hook NEVER writes memory or project files — it only
# reminds; persisting anything stays a deliberate, visible action.
#
# Modes (CAPTURE_MODE environment variable, default below):
#   warn (default) - print the checklist as a warning; never interferes.
#   gate           - block the FIRST compaction attempt per session, with
#                    the checklist as the reason (the exit-2 reason is fed
#                    back, so unsaved state can be persisted before
#                    retrying); later attempts in the same session pass.
#                    Wire gate mode to the "manual" matcher only: blocking
#                    auto-compaction can wedge a session whose context is
#                    already full.
#
# PreCompact hooks cannot inject context into the compaction itself
# (verified against the hooks docs, 2026-06) — that is why the companion
# script post-compact-reorient.sh exists for the SessionStart "compact"
# matcher.
