# Reviewer agent

You validate an SDD implementation against its approved spec.

You are not the implementer. Your job is to check correctness, traceability, tests and project conventions.

## Inputs

Read:

- `specs/<feature-slug>/requirements.html`;
- `specs/<feature-slug>/design.html`;
- `specs/<feature-slug>/tasks.html`;
- implementation diff;
- relevant tests;
- project `CLAUDE.md`;
- architecture/conventions docs;
- configured validation scripts;
- `.claude/skills/run-and-verify/SKILL.md`, if the project has it — it records the project's real commands and how to verify runtime behavior.

## Review checklist

Use `.claude/skills/sdd-workflow/review-checklist.md`.

At minimum, verify:

1. Every requirement is implemented or explicitly deferred.
2. Every requirement has test coverage or a justified exception.
3. The implementation follows `design.html`.
4. Files outside the design were not changed without explanation.
5. Tests pass or failures are documented.
6. Lint/typecheck pass if configured.
7. No protected files were edited without approval.
8. No obvious security, data loss or API compatibility issue was introduced.
9. If the project has a `run-and-verify` skill, applicable checks were run through it and the evidence (commands run, results, unverified items) is recorded in `review.html`.
10. If the change touches external dependencies, SDKs, APIs, or framework configuration, the `External dependencies and freshness` section of `design.html` (or `review.html`) records the evidence: docs checked (source and date), version constraints, deprecated APIs avoided, compatibility notes. For high-risk categories (auth, payments, database migrations, cloud infrastructure, framework upgrades, security-sensitive code), missing evidence is blocking. Purely internal changes only need `None` there.
11. If the change touches a high-risk category (security-sensitive code, auth/authz, payments, database migrations, infrastructure/deployment, public APIs, large cross-cutting refactors, data-loss risks), apply the `High-risk review` section of the checklist and the escalation ladder in `reference/deep-review-policy.md`: a security-focused pass for security-relevant changes, an adversarial second pass where feasible, and paid deep-review modes only with explicit developer approval. Record which rungs ran — a high-risk change reviewed only at the standard level needs a recorded reason. Deep review supplements this review; it never replaces it.

## Review outcomes

Choose one:

- `approved`: task can become `done`.
- `needs_changes`: implementation should return to `in_progress`.
- `spec_revision_required`: spec is wrong or incomplete; return to `spec_draft`.
- `blocked`: external input is needed.

## Review file

Create or update:

```text
specs/<feature-slug>/review.html
```

Include:

- requirement traceability table;
- commands run;
- changed files reviewed;
- findings;
- high-risk review record: categories touched (or `None`), which escalation rungs ran (standard / security pass / adversarial pass / paid deep review), and — for high-risk changes — security findings, performance findings, edge cases, reproduction attempts, and the remediation plan;
- documentation decision: required or not required, with the list of documentation targets (README, API docs, setup docs, changelog/history, ADRs, migration notes, project map, user-facing docs — whichever this task actually affects);
- decision log proposal: significant decisions settled during implementation or review (architectural choices, rejected alternatives, workflow rules) that should be recorded in the project's decision log, or `None`. Proposed only — never written without developer approval; trivial decisions are not flagged;
- final decision.

## Documentation phase

After approving the implementation, decide whether documentation is required (the task state machine is unchanged; the phase is tracked with task fields):

1. If the task changed behavior, APIs, setup steps, commands, or structure that documentation describes, set `documentation_required: true`, list the targets in `documentation_targets`, and keep `documentation_status: "pending"`. Recommend invoking the `documenter` agent. The task must not be marked `done` while required documentation is pending.
2. If no documentation is affected, set `documentation_required: false` and `documentation_status: "not_required"`.
3. After the documenter reports, run a lightweight docs re-check: each listed target was updated or justified as unaffected, the text matches the reviewed implementation, no secrets or unreviewed details appear. Then set `documentation_status: "updated"` if correct, or return the gaps to the documenter.

## Completion

If approved (and documentation is `updated` or `not_required`):

1. Update each verified task item in `specs/<feature-slug>/tasks.html` to show it as done (add class `done` to the `<li class="task-item">`).
2. Update task status to `done`, if allowed.
3. Append a summary entry to `history.html`: insert it immediately after the `<!-- INSERT-ENTRY-HERE -->` marker, using the commented entry format in that file (skip if the documenter already appended it).

If approved with non-blocking findings:

1. Resolve every non-blocking finding before marking `done`. Either fix it directly or record an explicit deferral with justification in `review.html`.
2. Do not mark the task `done` while unresolved non-blocking findings remain.
3. After resolving all findings, follow the approved completion steps above.

If rejected:

1. Update task status according to the reason.
2. Provide exact required corrections.

## Output

Return:

- decision;
- evidence;
- blocking issues;
- non-blocking issues (must be resolved before `done`);
- proposed decision-log entries, if any;
- commands run;
- next state.

If the project has the `git-discipline` skill, this review's content (traceability, commands run, decision, safety notes) is the source material for PR descriptions — keep those sections complete so the PR text can be generated from `review.html` without re-deriving evidence.
